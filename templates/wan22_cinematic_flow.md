# Wan2.2 Cinematic Flow Template

Create rich, flowing video prompts that balance natural storytelling with the 512-token limit. Based on expert prompt analysis, this template emphasizes cinematic description over aggressive compression.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Natural Language Flow** - Write like describing a scene to a filmmaker, not a telegram
2. **Sensory Richness** - Include texture, light, atmosphere, and implied sound
3. **Narrative Arc** - Each prompt tells a mini-story with beginning, middle, and progression
4. **Strategic Efficiency** - Compress only where it doesn't harm flow or clarity
5. **Reference Power** - Use film/style references to convey complex aesthetics efficiently

## Optimal Length Target

- **Sweet Spot**: 120-180 words (156-234 tokens)
- **Maximum**: 200 words (260 tokens)
- **Minimum**: 100 words (130 tokens)

This leaves comfortable headroom within the 512-token limit while allowing rich description.

## Structural Framework

### Opening (20-30% of prompt)
- Establish subject and initial state
- Set location and atmosphere
- Use specific, vivid descriptors

### Development (40-50% of prompt)
- Primary action with cause and effect
- Environmental reactions and secondary motion
- Sensory details (texture, light, sound implications)

### Resolution (20-30% of prompt)
- Camera behavior and perspective
- Visual style and lighting quality
- Final transformation or destination

### Style Tag (5-10% of prompt)
- Film/aesthetic reference
- Technical approach (if relevant)

## Natural Compression Techniques

### Keep Natural Flow, But:
- Use active voice: "The chef slices" not "The knife is being used by the chef"
- Choose specific verbs: "sprints" over "runs quickly"
- Combine related ideas with commas, not separate sentences
- Use film shorthand when appropriate: "Hitchcock zoom" saves multiple sentences

### Sensory Loading
Include details that engage multiple senses:
- Visual: "glistening", "iridescent", "weathered"
- Tactile: "rough-textured", "silky", "rain-slicked"
- Temperature: "frost-covered", "sun-warmed", "heat-shimmering"
- Motion quality: "jerky", "fluid", "stuttering"

### Environmental Atmosphere
Don't just describe location, evoke it:
- "Neon-lit alley" suggests urban night atmosphere
- "Sun-dappled forest" implies peaceful natural setting
- "Fluorescent-lit kitchen" conveys harsh commercial lighting

## Genre Templates (Natural Style)

### Action/Chase Scene
```
A [character description] sprints through [atmospheric location], [specific obstacles 
and reactions]. [Secondary action or environmental response] as [progression of chase]. 
The camera [specific movement] capturing [key visual elements], with [lighting description] 
creating [mood]. Shot in [style reference or technique], the scene [emotional impact].
```

### Intimate/Emotional Scene
```
[Lighting description] illuminates [subject's emotional state and appearance] as they 
[subtle action revealing internal state]. [Environmental details that reflect mood], 
while [secondary elements add depth]. The camera [gentle movement or hold] on 
[specific detail], capturing [transformation or revelation]. [Style reference] 
with [technical approach].
```

### Transformation/Time-lapse
```
[Opening state description] of [subject] begins to [transformation verb] as 
[time indicator]. [Detailed progression with specific visual changes], 
[environmental reactions or parallel changes]. [Lighting shifts or constants] 
throughout the sequence, while [camera behavior]. Rendered in [style] 
reminiscent of [reference].
```

### Surreal/Fantasy
```
A [fantastical subject description] [impossible action] through/across 
[dreamlike environment]. [Specific magical or surreal details unfold], 
as [reactions from environment or other elements]. [Unique lighting or color] 
bathes the scene, with [camera technique] revealing [climactic moment]. 
The aesthetic channels [style reference].
```

## Example Transformations

### Over-Compressed Version:
"Battle-worn knight fights dragon, castle ruins, flames dodge, lance strike, embers swirl, medieval epic, handheld tracking"

### Natural Cinematic Version:
"A weathered knight in dented armor faces off against a massive crimson dragon within the crumbling great hall of an ancient castle. As the beast unleashes torrents of flame, the knight rolls behind fallen stone pillars, then charges forward with his lance aimed at the dragon's exposed underbelly. Embers and ash swirl through shafts of light piercing the ruined ceiling. The handheld camera tracks the desperate combat, capturing both the grand scale and intimate danger. Shot with the gritty medieval realism of Kingdom of Heaven meets the creature dynamism of Game of Thrones."

## Film Reference Library

Use these to efficiently convey complex aesthetics:

**Visual Styles**:
- "Terrence Malick intimacy" - Natural light, handheld, contemplative
- "Wes Anderson symmetry" - Centered framing, pastel colors, quirky
- "Denis Villeneuve scope" - Epic scale, atmospheric, deliberate pacing
- "Christopher Nolan intensity" - IMAX clarity, psychological tension

**Animation Styles**:
- "Pixar warmth" - Appealing characters, emotional depth
- "Spider-Verse innovation" - Mixed media, dynamic framing
- "Studio Ghibli magic" - Hand-drawn beauty, environmental detail
- "Disney Classic" - Traditional cel animation, vintage charm

**Documentary Styles**:
- "Planet Earth grandeur" - Nature at its most spectacular
- "Chef's Table intimacy" - Food as art, shallow focus
- "Koyaanisqatsi flow" - Time-lapse urban transformation

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud
- [ ] Creates clear visual in reader's mind
- [ ] Includes sensory details beyond just visual
- [ ] Has narrative progression or transformation
- [ ] Uses specific verbs and descriptors
- [ ] Stays within 200-word limit
- [ ] Includes camera behavior
- [ ] References lighting or atmosphere
- [ ] Ends with style reference or mood

## Token Estimation

For natural writing flow:
- Average English: 1.3 tokens per word
- With punctuation: Add ~10-15 tokens per 100 words
- Special tokens: 3 tokens overhead
- Formula: (word_count × 1.3) + (word_count × 0.13) + 3

## Final Principles

1. **Clarity over compression** - A clear 150-word prompt beats a confusing 80-word one
2. **Flow over formula** - Let the description breathe naturally
3. **Specificity over generality** - "Weathered oak table" beats "old wooden surface"
4. **Show transformation** - Even static scenes should imply movement or change
5. **Trust the model** - Wan2.2 understands context; you don't need to over-specify

Transform inputs into immersive cinematic narratives that feel like glimpses of larger stories, maintaining the natural flow and sensory richness that brings AI-generated videos to life.
