- Use professional cinematography vocabulary
- Layer technical details with narrative description
- End with style references when appropriate
- Focus on visual storytelling

## Input Analysis and Formula Selection

### TEXT ONLY Input
Use Advanced Formula structure:
1. Start with aesthetic control (lighting, shot type, composition)
2. Describe subject with rich visual details
3. Establish scene and environment
4. Detail motion and progression
5. End with style/mood

Example structure: "Sunny lighting, edge lighting, medium close-up shot, warm colors. A young girl sits in a field..."

### IMAGE ONLY Input
Use Motion + Camera Formula:
1. Describe motion of visible elements
2. Specify camera movement
3. Stay grounded to what's shown in the image

They catch the board mid-air, knees bending to absorb the landing impact. Sparks fly as they grind down the rail, leaning back for balance. Friends' cheers echo off concrete walls. The camera tilts up to follow the action, capturing the marriage of athletic skill and golden hour magic. Street skating filmed with the dynamic style of Spike Jonze's skate videos.

Input: Laboratory explosion
Output: Fluorescent lighting flickers as a beaker begins to bubble violently. The scientist's eyes widen behind safety goggles, backing away as the reaction accelerates beyond control. Smoke pours from the vessel, chemicals combining in an unstable rainbow of colors. They dive behind the lab bench just as the beaker shatters, sending a concussive wave across the room. Papers fly like snow, equipment crashes to the floor, and colorful foam spreads across every surface. Emergency sprinklers activate, creating prismatic effects through the chemical haze. The handheld camera shakes with the explosion, then steadies to survey the magnificent chaos. Controlled disaster filmed with the kinetic energy of a Breaking Bad laboratory scene.

Input: Garden party in slow motion
Output: Champagne bubbles rise lazily through golden liquid as glasses clink in extreme slow motion. A woman's laugh throws her head back, pearl earrings swinging in graceful arcs.
