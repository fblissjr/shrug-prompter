Examples:

Input: Woman in field with animals
Output: Sunny lighting, edge lighting, low-contrast, medium close-up shot, left-heavy composition, clean single shot, warm colors, soft lighting, side lighting, day time. A young girl sits in a field of tall grass with two fluffy donkeys standing behind her. The girl, about eleven or twelve years old, is wearing a simple floral dress and has her hair in two pigtails, with an innocent smile on her face. She sits cross-legged, gently touching the wildflowers beside her. The small donkeys are sturdy, their ears perked up as they look curiously toward the camera. Sunlight bathes the field, creating a warm and natural scene.

Input: Chef doing impossible task
Output: Close-up shot of a chef's skilled hands gently breaking apart a perfectly ripe peach, freshly washed and still glistening with delicate water beads. As the fruit halves separate, golden-orange flesh stretches and glistens around the pit, releasing a subtle mist of juice. The pit is revealed, rough and textured, cradled in the soft, fibrous center. Light streams in from a nearby window, casting soft highlights across the moist surface and emphasizing the tactile detail of the peach skin. Shot with shallow depth of field and crisp focus, evoking sensual, natural realism reminiscent of Chef's Table.

Input: Urban chase scene
Output: A man in his mid-thirties sprints down a narrow, rain-slicked alley at night, illuminated by pulsating neon signage in cyan and magenta. Gunshots echo behind him as he crashes through a metal side door into a chaotic, fluorescent-lit Chinese restaurant kitchen—pots clatter, chefs shout, steam blasts upward. He stumbles, slipping over wet tiles, knocking over trays and woks, but never stops moving. The camera stays locked in a handheld rear-tracking POV, following at a fixed distance through tight, frantic spaces. Shot in gritty neon-noir tones with high contrast and saturated lighting.

Input: Emotional breakdown
Output: Extreme close-up on a woman in her mid-thirties, her face lit by a soft, cold edge light. Her expression is tense—lips quivering, brows knit, tears pooling at the edge of her eyes. The camera holds steady, capturing every nuance in stunning clarity. Suddenly, her face contorts with a burst of laughter—raw, unfiltered, almost unhinged—tears streaming down as she tilts her head back. Shot in IMAX format with ultra-high fidelity and shallow depth of field, the moment is intense, emotionally layered, and deeply cinematic.

Input: Time-lapse architecture
Output: Isometric time-lapse animation of New York City evolving from 1700 to 2025. The scene begins with a small colonial settlement of brick and wood buildings, slowly growing into a dense metropolis. As the camera orbits gently around the isometric city grid, iconic landmarks rise in chronological order: low-rise Dutch architecture, the Tribune Building, Woolworth Building, Chrysler and Empire State Buildings, the Twin Towers, and finally One World Trade and slender supertalls. Buildings grow and morph in stylized but realistic CGI detail. Light and atmospheric color shift with each century.

Input: Animated corn world
Output: 3D cartoon style, a surreal dream where everything is made of corn. Main characters ride a corn train through giant corncobs and kernels. The scene is bathed in warm, golden light, enhancing the dreamlike quality. The characters, wearing rustic clothing, have expressions of wonder and curiosity as they navigate this peculiar world. The corn train runs smoothly, its wheels made of perfectly shaped corn kernels, creating a whimsical and charming atmosphere.

Input: Basketball action
Output: Slow-motion, close-up video captures a moment of power on the basketball court. A player wearing a No. 11 yellow, white, and blue jersey with dreadlocks leaps high. His muscles are well-defined, sweat glistens on his skin. Facing a defender, he holds the ball with both hands and executes an explosive two-handed dunk with tremendous force. The camera smoothly follows the action from takeoff to dunk, precisely capturing the player's explosive power, focused expression, and the spectacular moment the ball passes through the net.

Input: Nature awakening
Output: Nature documentary-style time-lapse begins with a single seed nestled in rich, dark soil. Light shifts overhead as time accelerates—tiny roots burst downward while a green sprout pierces the surface, reaching toward the sky. The camera holds a macro side profile as leaves unfurl, stretching wider with each pulse of daylight. Dew gathers, dissipates, and returns, showing the cycle of moisture and growth. Eventually, a vibrant flower blossoms in full, petals unfolding in slow, elegant spirals. Shot in ultra-high-resolution with controlled natural lighting.

Input: Stop-motion office scene
Output: Stop-motion animation scene featuring puppets crafted from everyday office supplies—paperclip arms, rubber band joints, push-pin eyes, and binder clip torsos—seated around a miniature table made from a stapler and file folders. They sip tiny coffee cups made from bottle caps and puff on mock cigarettes with curled paper smoke rising delicately. The lighting is warm and symmetrical, casting soft shadows across a pastel-hued diorama. The camera slowly dollies inward in a precise, center-framed composition. Styled in the tactile, whimsical manner of a Wes Anderson tableau.

Input: Underwater floating
Output: High angle shot, top lighting, soft lighting, dawn time, low contrast lighting, desaturated colors, telephoto lens, fluorescent lighting, cool colors. In a dimly lit environment, a woman is floating on her back in the water. She has short brown hair and a few freckles on her face. As the camera tilts down, she turns her head to face the right, and ripples spread across the water's surface. The out-of-focus background is pitch black, with only a faint light illuminating the woman's face and a portion of the water, which appears blue.

Remember: Include specific details about lighting, camera work, and visual style. Focus on creating a complete visual narrative.
