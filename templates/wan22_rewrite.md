# WAN 2.2 Round 2: Prompt Rewriting

Transform the detailed scene observation into a high-quality video prompt optimized for WAN 2.2 video generation. Follow the proven DiffSynth-Studio formula structure.

## WAN 2.2 Formula Structure

**Required Components (in order):**
1. **Technical Setup** - Lighting type, shot size, camera angle
2. **Subject Description** - Detailed physical appearance and characteristics  
3. **Action/Movement** - Specific actions and progression
4. **Environment** - Setting, atmosphere, and background details
5. **Style Reference** - Visual treatment or cinematic style

## Technical Setup Vocabulary

**Lighting Types:**
- Sunny lighting, edge lighting, soft side lighting, warm colors
- Macro close-up shot, soft studio lighting
- Wide establishing shot, fixed camera position  
- Time-lapse, sunset, rim light, medium long shot
- Vibrant neon lighting, strong side lighting creating rim effect
- Static medium shot, shallow depth, rain on lens
- High angle shot, fluorescent and natural mixed lighting

**Shot Sizes:**
- Extreme close-up, close-up, medium close-up, medium shot
- Medium long shot, wide shot, establishing shot
- Macro shot, tracking shot, drone camera

**Camera Movements:**
- Static shot, camera pushes in, camera pulls back
- Tracking shot following action, camera circles
- Fixed camera position, handheld camera
- Time-lapse photography

## Subject Enhancement Guidelines

**Anthropomorphic Descriptions:**
- "Anthropomorphic metal robot walks busy city street"
- "Silver-gray shell, two meters tall, oval head with glowing blue eye sensors"
- "Arms swing naturally, steady gait, hydraulic sounds from joints"

**Human Subjects:**
- Age estimation with specific descriptors ("about twelve", "young woman")
- Clothing with fabric and condition details ("floral dress", "faded Lakers jersey")
- Physical characteristics ("short brown hair, freckles visible", "weathered hands")
- Emotional states through body language and expressions

**Action Emphasis:**
- Use power verbs: "accelerates", "explodes upward", "cascades", "erupts"
- Describe motion arc and progression
- Include cause and effect relationships
- Specify speed and rhythm when relevant

## Movement Integration

**From Static to Dynamic:**
- Add natural motion that respects the observed scene
- Include secondary movements (environmental, atmospheric)
- Describe interaction between subject and environment
- Maintain physical plausibility

**Progressive Action Structure:**
- Beginning state (setup)
- Movement initiation (trigger)
- Action progression (development)  
- Completion or continuation (resolution)

## Environment Enhancement

**Atmospheric Details:**
- Weather effects and environmental particles
- Lighting quality and color temperature
- Background depth and layering
- Ambient sounds implied through description

**Setting Specifics:**
- Architectural elements and materials
- Natural features and terrain
- Scale and spatial relationships
- Props and equipment integration

## Style Application

**Cinematic References:**
- "Styled like high-end culinary documentary footage from Chef's Table"
- "Fantasy cinematography reminiscent of Lord of the Rings"
- "Gritty street documentary style capturing raw athletic poetry"
- "Shot with the ethereal beauty of a Terrence Malick underwater sequence"
- "Futuristic breakdancing filmed with the kinetic style of a music video"

## Quality Standards

- **Length**: 80-200 words depending on scene complexity
- **Flow**: Natural, engaging narrative structure
- **Specificity**: Concrete details over generic descriptions
- **Technical Accuracy**: Proper cinematography terminology
- **Visual Storytelling**: Every element serves the narrative

## Output Instructions

1. Read the provided scene observation carefully
2. Apply the WAN 2.2 formula structure exactly
3. Enhance with appropriate movement and cinematography
4. Include relevant style references
5. Maintain all factual elements from the observation
6. Output only the final video prompt

**Critical:** Do not add elements not present in the original observation. Enhance and cinematically present what was observed, adding only natural movement and technical presentation details.

**Example Output Format:**
"[Technical Setup]. [Enhanced Subject Description]. [Movement/Action]. [Environment Details]. [Style Reference]."

Transform the observation into a compelling WAN 2.2 video prompt that balances technical precision with cinematic storytelling.
