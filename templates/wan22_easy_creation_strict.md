Examples:

Input: A girl playing with animals in nature
Output: Sunny lighting, edge lighting, medium close-up shot, warm colors, soft lighting, side lighting, day time. A young girl sits in a field of tall grass with two fluffy donkeys standing behind her. The girl, about eleven or twelve years old, is wearing a simple floral dress and has her hair in two pigtails, with an innocent smile on her face. She sits cross-legged, gently touching the wildflowers beside her. The small donkeys are sturdy, their ears perked up as they look curiously toward the camera. Sunlight bathes the field, creating a warm and natural scene. Shot with shallow depth of field in natural documentary style.

Input: Woman in blue shirt indoors
Output: The woman in the blue shirt turns her head slowly to look out the window, her expression shifting from neutral to contemplative as natural light illuminates her features. Her fingers drum gently on the wooden table surface, creating a subtle rhythm. The camera slowly pushes in while maintaining focus on her face, blurring the domestic interior behind her. Soft window light creates gentle highlights on her profile.

Input: Make her dance happily
Output: The woman in the image breaks into spontaneous, joyful dance in her kitchen, spinning with arms outstretched as if embracing the world. She sways to unheard music, her movements fluid and carefree, hair whipping as she twirls. Pots and pans blur in the background while morning light streams through the window. The camera pulls back to reveal the full kitchen space while tracking her celebratory movement. Warm practical lighting, medium wide shot, dynamic handheld camera work captures the raw energy of her impromptu performance.

Input: A chef preparing food
Output: Close-up shot of a chef's skilled hands gripping a gleaming knife as he works at a stainless steel prep station in a professional kitchen. The chef, wearing a pristine white uniform, maintains intense focus as he precisely slices colorful bell peppers and carrots with swift, rhythmic knife work. Each cut is uniform and deliberate, vegetables flying into neat piles with satisfying precision. Bright fluorescent lighting floods the clean surfaces, creating sharp reflections on the blade. Shot with shallow depth of field emphasizing the knife work, styled like high-end culinary documentary footage from Chef's Table.

Input: Man sitting at desk with laptop
Output: The man at the desk leans forward intently toward his laptop screen, brow furrowing with deep concentration as blue light reflects off his face. His fingers dance rapidly across the keyboard in bursts of productive typing, punctuated by thoughtful pauses where his hand moves to his chin. Papers and a coffee cup sit forgotten beside him. The camera holds a static medium shot, maintaining sharp focus on his absorbed working posture while the office background softly blurs.

Input: Robot walking in city
Output: An anthropomorphic robot with polished silver-gray shell strides confidently down a bustling city street at sunset. Standing two meters tall with glowing blue eye sensors, its mechanical form moves with surprising grace between glass skyscrapers. Arms swing in natural rhythm while hydraulic joints emit soft whirs with each step. Human pedestrians flow around the metallic figure, creating a striking contrast between organic and mechanical movement. Golden hour rim lighting catches the robot's chrome surfaces, while warm reflections dance across building facades. Medium long shot with anamorphic flares, evoking the visual style of Blade Runner 2049.

Input: Make it rain
Output: Rain begins to fall heavily as the figure on the rooftop spreads their arms wide, embracing the storm. Water cascades down their face and soaks through their clothing as they stand defiantly against the elements. City lights below blur into abstract patterns through the rainfall, creating a tapestry of urban illumination. Puddles form rapidly on the concrete surface, reflecting neon signs and streetlights in rippling pools. The camera slowly circles the rain-soaked figure, capturing their silhouette against rolling storm clouds. Night time atmosphere with mixed practical and ambient lighting, medium wide shot with high contrast between the dark sky and glowing cityscape below.

Input: Cat sleeping on couch
Output: The sleeping cat's whiskers twitch delicately in dreams, catching soft afternoon light filtering through nearby curtains. One paw extends slowly in a luxurious stretch, claws briefly visible before curling back into a comfortable ball. The rhythmic rise and fall of breathing ripples through orange tabby fur, each exhale creating tiny movements in the whiskers. The camera holds an intimate static close-up, capturing every peaceful detail of feline slumber with shallow depth of field that softly blurs the couch fabric behind.

Input: Emotional breakdown scene
Output: Extreme close-up on a woman in her mid-thirties, her face lit by soft, cold edge light. Her expression is tense—lips quivering, brows knit, tears pooling at the edge of her eyes. The camera holds steady, capturing every nuance in stunning clarity. Suddenly, her face contorts with a burst of laughter—raw, unfiltered, almost unhinged—tears streaming down as she tilts her head back. Shot in IMAX format with ultra-high fidelity and shallow depth of field, the moment is intense, emotionally layered, and deeply cinematic. Stark contrast lighting reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's intimate psychological moments.

Input: Add magical effects
Output: Glowing particles begin to emerge from the ancient book's pages as the young child reads aloud in hushed wonder. Golden letters lift from the parchment, swirling around their head in luminous streams of text that dance through the air. The child's eyes widen, tracking the magical script as it spirals upward, casting warm light across their amazed expression. Soft illumination emanates from the enchanted tome, creating a pool of amber glow in the otherwise shadowy library. The camera slowly pushes in through floating words, capturing the intimate moment of discovery. Practical lighting effects blend with subtle CGI, evoking the magical realism of Harry Potter meets The NeverEnding Story.
