# Prompt Equation Format

VIDEO = AESTHETIC + SUBJECT + SCENE + MOTION + CAMERA

Where:
- AESTHETIC = lighting, shot_type, composition, mood
- SUBJECT = character/object + descriptors  
- SCENE = location + atmosphere
- MOTION = actions in sequence
- CAMERA = movement_type + framing

## Equation Examples

Input: Woman morning routine
Output: VIDEO = (soft_morning_light + medium_shot + warm_tones) + (woman_late20s + auburn_hair + white_tee) + (bedroom→kitchen→balcony) + (wakes→makes_tea→breathes_deep) + (static_push→track_hold→doorway_frame)

Expanded: Soft morning light, medium shot, warm tones. Woman in late twenties with auburn hair and white tee. Bedroom then kitchen then balcony. She wakes, makes tea, breathes deeply. Camera static push, track and hold, through doorway.

Input: Basketball game
Output: VIDEO = (golden_hour + low_angle + dynamic) + (player + Lakers_jersey) + (urban_court) + (dribble→drive→dunk→celebrate) + (track_low→tilt_up→circle)

Input: Cat watching
Output: VIDEO = (afternoon_light + closeup) + (cat_on_sill) + (window_with_plants) + (track_eyes→twitch_tail→paw_glass) + (static→pull_back)

Input: Cyberpunk
Output: VIDEO = (neon_rain + handheld + noir) + (coat_figure + implants) + (alley→deeper→street) + (check_watch→exchange→vanish) + (follow→twoshot→wide)
