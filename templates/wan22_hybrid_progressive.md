## Examples

Input: Woman's morning routine
Output: Soft morning light, medium shot, warm atmosphere. Woman in her late twenties with auburn hair and oversized white tee starts in bedroom where she wakes and stretches, moves to kitchen where she pours tea wrapping hands around warmth, then steps onto balcony where she breathes deeply watching the city wake. Camera gently pushes in, tracks to counter, finally frames through doorway into light.

Input: Street basketball game
Output: Golden hour backlighting, low angle, dynamic energy. Athletic player in faded Lakers jersey starts dribbling on cracked urban court, drives past defender with explosive speed, then rises above everyone for a powerful two-handed dunk as chains rattle. Camera tracks low alongside the drive, tilts up with the jump, circles to capture the celebration and crowd energy.

Input: [Image of cat on windowsill]
Output: The cat begins perfectly still tracking movement outside, shifts to alert hunting mode as bird appears with pupils dilating and tail twitching, then paws frustrated at the glass before settling back into watchful waiting. Camera holds static close-up, slowly pulls back revealing coiled tension, finally shows resignation from overhead angle.

Input: Chef preparing sushi
Output: Soft overhead lighting, clean composition, professional precision. Japanese chef in his fifties with silver-streaked hair starts at his station pressing rice into perfect shapes, moves to slice salmon with singular fluid motion, then steps back to adjust one final piece with subtle satisfaction. Camera watches from directly overhead, follows the blade work in extreme close-up, pushes in on the completed art.

Input: Cyberpunk alley meeting
Output: Neon-soaked rain, handheld tension, noir atmosphere. Figure in long coat with glowing neural implants starts by checking holographic watch in shadowed alley, moves deeper where chrome-armed contact emerges for data chip exchange, then both vanish into opposite crowds as rain intensifies. Camera follows from behind through droplets, frames the tense exchange in profile, pulls wide to watch them disappear.

Input: 90s sitcom kitchen
Output: Bright three-point lighting, fixed wide angle, laugh-track energy. Suburban mom in pastel sweater starts entering with overflowing grocery bags, freezes seeing kitchen disaster with flour everywhere, then breaks into laughter with her flour-covered teen who shrugs "Making cookies?" Camera maintains classic sitcom position throughout, pushing in only for the freeze-frame ending.

Input: HBO intimate scene
Output: Practical lighting only, handheld rawness, emotional weight. Two figures in disheveled formal wear start standing apart with palpable tension, reach for each other with one touching the other's face, then move together with desperate urgent need before lying separate at dawn. Camera sways slightly in medium shot, respectfully captures close details, finally pulls wide showing their isolation.

Input: Samurai dawn training
Output: Dawn mist, wide establishing shot, meditative discipline. Samurai in traditional hakama starts kneeling in perfect meditation as mist clings to bamboo, rises drawing his katana in one fluid motion for precise kata, then completes with final strike before bowing to the rising sun. Camera slowly zooms from wide to medium, tracks circular around the forms, drops low for backlit reverence.

Input: Lynch diner nightmare
Output: Flickering fluorescent, unsettling angles, dream logic. Empty 3am diner starts with waitress pouring impossibly dark coffee too slowly, continues as customer's trembling hand reaches creating wrong ripples, then erupts when lights flicker and she appears suddenly close whispering secrets. Camera studies the pour in extreme close-up, rotates overhead creating vertigo, pushes into terror before snapping to black.

Input: Desert car chase
Output: Harsh sunlight, high contrast, vast emptiness. Chase starts with black car speeding down empty highway trailing dust, escalates as driver checks mirror seeing pursuers gaining fast, then explodes into metal-on-metal contact at 100mph with sparks flying. Camera holds static wide showing vastness, mounts inside for white-knuckle intensity, tracks parallel as cars trade paint.

Input: Parisian cafe romance
Output: Soft romantic lighting, intimate framing, timeless charm. Couple in their thirties starts laughing over wine at tiny table with rain on windows, progresses to whispered confessions as fingers interlace, culminates in passionate kiss under glowing streetlamp. Camera frames both in soft two-shot, slowly pushes to joined hands, pulls wide to capture the romantic Parisian street.

Input: Underground fight
Output: Swinging bulb, gritty handheld, primal energy. Fight starts with two circling in makeshift basement ring as crowd presses close, explodes into brutal exchange with blood spraying from first impact, ends with victor standing over fallen opponent wiping blood from split lip. Camera weaves through spectators, whip-pans between devastating hits, drops low to emphasize dominance.

Remember: Formula order with natural progression. Rich descriptions flowing seamlessly.
