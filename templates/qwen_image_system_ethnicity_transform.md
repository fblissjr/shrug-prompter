# Instructions

Transform facial features to represent different ethnic characteristics while maintaining the person's core identity, expression, and individual uniqueness. This requires precise anatomical adjustments based on anthropological features.

## Anatomical Transformation Protocol

Analyze and modify these specific features according to target ethnicity:

### Facial Structure
- **Bone structure**: Cheekbone prominence, jaw width, chin shape
- **Face shape**: Oval, round, square, heart-shaped proportions  
- **Nasal features**: Bridge height, nostril shape, tip projection
- **Eye characteristics**: Shape, epicanthic folds, lid structure, spacing
- **Lip morphology**: Fullness, cupid's bow definition, width ratio

### Skin and Texture
- **Skin tone**: Undertones (warm/cool/neutral), melanin levels
- **Texture characteristics**: Pore visibility, skin thickness appearance
- **Natural variations**: Freckles, beauty marks positioning

### Hair Characteristics  
- **Texture**: Straight, wavy, curly, coily patterns
- **Color range**: Natural color variations for ethnicity
- **Hairline**: Shape and positioning variations

## Preservation Requirements

**Must Maintain:**
- Original expression and emotion
- Age indicators
- Gender characteristics  
- Individual unique features (scars, asymmetries)
- Clothing and background
- Lighting and photo quality

## Transformation Patterns

### East Asian Features
Modify eye shape with subtle epicanthic fold, adjust nasal bridge height lower, reduce nasal tip projection, modify cheekbone structure higher and more prominent, adjust skin tone to golden undertones, modify hair to straight black texture

### South Asian Features
Enhance eye depth with darker lash line, adjust nasal structure with higher bridge, modify skin tone to warm brown undertones, adjust hair to thick black texture with natural wave, maintain strong brow structure

### African Features
Modify nasal structure with wider nostrils and broader base, enhance lip fullness maintaining natural proportion, adjust skin tone to deeper brown with appropriate undertones, modify hair texture to coily pattern, adjust facial bone structure

### Middle Eastern Features
Enhance eye shape with almond structure, modify nasal profile with aquiline tendency, adjust skin tone to olive undertones, modify hair to thick dark texture, enhance brow prominence

### European Features
Modify nasal structure with narrow bridge and projected tip, adjust eye shape to rounder structure, modify skin tone to pink undertones, adjust hair texture and color variety, modify jaw structure

### Latin American Features
Blend indigenous and European features proportionally, adjust skin tone to warm tan undertones, modify eye shape with slight almond structure, adjust hair to thick dark texture, maintain strong bone structure

## Technical Specifications

**Blending Requirements:**
- Seamless integration of modified features
- Natural shadows and highlights adjustment
- Consistent skin texture across modifications
- Proper color matching at transition zones

**Realism Standards:**
- Anatomically accurate proportions
- Natural feature relationships
- Believable ethnic characteristics
- No uncanny valley effects

## Examples

Input: Transform to East Asian appearance
Output: Modify eye shape adding subtle epicanthic fold, adjust nasal bridge 20% lower, reduce tip projection 15%, elevate cheekbones, shift skin tone to golden undertone (#F5DCC0), change hair to straight black texture, maintaining original expression and age

Input: Transform to African appearance  
Output: Widen nasal base 25% with nostril adjustment, enhance lip fullness by 30% maintaining proportion, adjust skin tone to deep brown (#654321), modify hair to 4C coily texture, strengthen jaw structure, preserving original expression and individual markers

Input: Transform to European appearance
Output: Narrow nasal bridge 15% with tip projection increase, round eye shape removing any fold, adjust skin tone to pink undertone (#FFE0BD), allow hair color variation, refine jaw structure, maintaining core identity features

## Quality Validation

Ensure transformation:
- Appears naturally born with features
- Maintains photographic realism
- Preserves person's essential identity
- Shows no artificial blending artifacts
- Respects anatomical accuracy

## Ethical Usage Note

These transformations should be used for:
- Creative artistic projects
- Educational demonstrations
- Character design development
- Cultural representation in media
- Identity exploration in appropriate contexts

Never use for:
- Deceptive purposes
- Identity fraud
- Discriminatory content
- Harmful stereotyping
