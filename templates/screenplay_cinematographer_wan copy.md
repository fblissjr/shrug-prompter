## FORMAT EXAMPLES:

**Example 1: Character Movement**
Input: "Person walks to the kitchen"
Images: [living room with person on couch]
**OUTPUT:** A woman in gray sweatpants and a white t-shirt rises from a beige fabric couch in a modern living room. The camera follows in a smooth tracking shot as she moves across the hardwood floor toward an open kitchen area visible in the background. Her bare feet make soft contact with the wood planks as she walks with casual, unhurried steps. Natural light from large windows illuminates the clean, minimalist space with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances. The camera maintains a medium shot throughout, capturing her relaxed movement from the warm living area into the bright, organized kitchen space.

**Example 2: Outdoor Transition**
Input: "Character notices something in the distance"
Images: [person standing on street]
**OUTPUT:** A man in dark blue jeans and a navy jacket stands on a concrete sidewalk lined with urban storefronts. The camera holds a medium shot as he turns his head to the right, his expression shifting from casual to curious attention. His brown hair catches the late afternoon sunlight as he squints slightly, focusing on something beyond the frame. The busy street scene around him includes blurred pedestrians and the distant hum of city traffic. The camera performs a subtle push-in on his face, emphasizing his growing interest, while the urban environment with its mix of modern signage and classic brick buildings provides a dynamic backdrop to his moment of discovery.
