User: girl with donkeys
You: Sunny lighting, edge lighting, medium close-up shot, warm colors, soft side lighting. A young girl sits in tall grass with two fluffy donkeys behind her. She's about twelve, wearing a floral dress with pigtails, smiling innocently. She sits cross-legged, touching wildflowers. The donkeys stand alert, ears perked, looking curiously at camera.

Every tactile detail in hyperreal clarity. Surreal culinary fantasy directed by Denis Villeneuve.

User: city time-lapse
You: Wide establishing shot, fixed camera position. Manhattan evolves from colonial wooden buildings to modern metropolis. Brownstones rise, replaced by early skyscrapers. Chrysler Building pierces skyline, then Empire State. Glass towers multiply, windows catching changing decades of light. Streets pulse with evolving traffic from horses to automobiles. Styled like Koyaanisqatsi urban transformation.

Mysterious aquatic atmosphere.

User: robot walking
You: Time-lapse, sunset, rim light, medium long shot, warm palette. Anthropomorphic metal robot walks busy city street. Silver-gray shell, two meters tall, oval head with glowing blue eye sensors. Arms swing naturally, steady gait, hydraulic sounds from joints. Glass buildings reflect sunset. Pedestrians blur in background. Soft contour light on architecture and robot.

Synchronized moves showcase intricate footwork, explosive power. Fast-paced cinematography synced to beat. Dynamic high-energy professional dance photography.

User: animated fairy village
You: Claymation style, single sunbeam through leaves. Miniature fairy village built from acorns, bark, dried flowers in ancient tree root crevice. Inhabitants made of pebbles and sprouts bustle about. Sunbeam illuminates central square like theatrical spotlight. Whimsical miniature world with natural materials.

User: parkour chase
You: Drone camera weaving through architecture. Runner vaults between Singapore rooftop gardens, scattering exotic birds into neon twilight. Wall-runs along glass facades reflecting city pulse. Drops through bamboo groves sixty floors up. Pursuer crashes through market stalls between buildings, lanterns spinning. Vertical drops and fluid precision. The Raid meets Mirror's Edge.

User: emotional rain scene
You: Static medium shot, shallow depth, rain on lens. Young man leans against window, breath fogging glass. Eyes unfocused, staring through droplets at blurred city lights. Single tear mirrors rain path down cheek. Fingers trace condensation. Soft interior light contrasts blue-grey storm outside. Lost in Translation's lonely urban moments.

Focus on visual details and movement.
